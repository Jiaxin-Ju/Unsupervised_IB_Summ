coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), is characterized by a vast release of cytokines. aggravated by following sepsis, this was established to be the cause of death in 28% of the infected patients . at the time of writing this manuscript, no cure nor vaccine exists yet and hence, many studies investigating treatment options have been initiated. amongst these, vagus nerve stimulation (vns) has been put forward as potential therapy because of its ability to induce an anti-inflammatory effect through dampening systemic inflammatory responses. this 'cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway' of the vagus nerve has been acknowledged for many years, in particular at the level of sepsis-related cytokines tumor necrosis factor (tnf), interleukin (il)-1, and high mobility group box 1 (hmbg1) (tracey 2002) . therefore, since the covid-19 outbreak late 2019, several trials (e.g. clini-caltrials.gov; nct04341415, nct04368156, nct04382391) have been originated to study the efficacy of electrical vns as treatment for this hyperinflammatory disease (staats et al. 2020; fudim et al. 2020) . however, clear evidence supporting the value of vns in treating covid-19 is lacking. thus far, it has been demonstrated that sars-cov-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) as the key receptor for entry and transmembrane serine protease 2 (tmprss2) for viral spike protein priming ). in addition, increasing evidence suggests that nicotinic receptors (nachrs) have a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of covid-19. for instance, an unusually low prevalence of cigarette smoking (characterized by prolonged nachr activation) was clinically observed in covid-19 patients (creamer et al. 2019; petrilli et al. 2020 ). this was confirmed by various systematic reviews showing the protective effect of current or former smoking habit against covid-19 hospitalization (farsalinos et al. 2020; team cc-r 2020) . although ace2 is abundantly present in lung alveolar epithelial and ciliated cells, the highest ace2 expression in the human body was found in intestinal enterocytes (hamming et al. 2004; qi et al. 2020) . intriguingly, nachrs are equally expressed by enterocytes in the intestinal epithelium (richardson et al. 2003; summers et al. 2003) . the gastrointestinal tract was therefore introduced as target organ for sars-cov-2 infection with up to 34% of covid-19 patients reporting digestive symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal discomfort (yang and tu 2020) . the virus can propagate through ace2 expressing enterocytes, and viral rna can be found in rectal swabs, even after negative nasopharyngeal testing (lamers et al. 2020; amirian 2020; xiao et al. 2020) . the aim of this study is to delineate ace2 expression in intestinal epithelial cells, and to evaluate the expression of nachrs in relation to ace2 in intestinal epithelium. further, we address the potency of vns in the reduction of sars-cov-2 transmission. to this end, we made use of intestinal tissues of mice and humans that underwent chronic electrical non-invasive vns administered via implanted devices (brinkman et al., manuscript in preparation) (bonaz et al. 2016; sinniger et al. 2020 ). publicly available single-cell rna-sequencing data from ileal biopsies obtained from crohn's disease patients (gse134809) was downloaded from the sequence read archive (sra) whereupon they were aligned against grch38 using cellranger (v3.1.0) and imported into the r statistical environment (v3.6.3) (martin et al. 2019; r core team 2016) . seurat (v3.1.5) was used to import, integrate, and cluster the data (butler et al. 2018; stuart et al. 2019) . data visualization was done in ggplot2 (v3.3.1) (wickham 2016) . louvain clustering analysis identified 22 cell clusters, with clusters 8, 11, 13, 14, and 18 likely representing the epithelial cells based on their expression of cdh1 and vil1. the epithelial clusters were first filtered for dead cells, identified on the basis of a low gene count and high (> 25%) percentage of mitochondrial dna, whereupon the cell cycle effects were regressed out using the cell cycle genes (nestorowa et al. 2016) . the epithelial cells were subjected to another round of clustering analysis to identify epithelial subsets (luecken and theis 2019) . specifically, we identified stem cells (lgr5, ascl2, olfm4, gkn3, slc12a2, axin2), goblet cells (muc2, tff3, clca3, agr2), enterocytes (fabp1, alpi, apoa1, apoa4), enteroendocrine cells (chga, chgb, tac1, tph1, neurog3), and tuft cells (dclk1, trpm5, gfi1b, il25) (haber et al. 2017; grun et al. 2015) . subsequently, coexpression of ace2 and tmprss2 with nachrs was assessed. vns of the left cervical vagus nerve was performed in patients with active crohn's disease continuously for 12 months as was described previously (fig. 1b) (bonaz et al. 2016; sinniger et al. 2020) . ileal and colonic biopsies were collected during ileocolonoscopy prior to start of vns, and 6 and 12 months after start of vns. these biopsies were used for mrna expression assessments. in total, 9 patients were included in the study. of these, 2 patients were removed from the study after a 3-month follow-up because of worsened clinical state. after 1 year of vns, 5 out of 7 patients were in clinical remission (assessed with the crohn's disease activity index, cdai), and 6 in endoscopic remission (assessed with the crohn's disease endoscopic index of severity, cdeis). the study was approved by the institutional ethics review board (identifier 11-chug-28), registered at clini-caltrials.gov (nct01569503), and was conducted in accordance with the helsinki declaration and the good clinical practice guidelines of the international council. female c57bl/6ncrl inbred mice (10 weeks old) were obtained from charles river laboratories, maastricht, the netherlands and acclimated for 1 week before performing experiments. the animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facility at the amsterdam university medical centers, location amc, amsterdam, the netherlands. animals were maintained on a 12/12 light/dark cycle under constant temperature (20°c ± 2°c) and humidity (55%) conditions with ad libitum drinking water and chow. mice were handled according to the guidelines of the animal research ethics committee of the university of amsterdam. experiments were conducted under a project (application number avd118002017842; license holder number 11800) approved by the dutch central animal experiments committee. individual experiments were revised and approved by the animal research ethics committee of the university of amsterdam. prior to the experiments protocols were approved by this same committee. a total of 32 mice were used for this study. . the procedure was performed on mice under anesthesia with 2.5% isoflurane in 100% o 2 (flow 1 l/min). preoperatively and 24 h postoperatively animals were administered 1 mg/kg meloxicam (metacam; boehringer, ingelheim am rein, germany) and 5 mg/kg enrofloxacin (baytril; beyer healthcare, whippany, nj, united states of america). local anesthetics were administered through a lidocaine splash block (2%) before wound closure. mice recovered for 10 days. at day 0, mice were allocated to the sham group when the impedance measurement of the implanted cuff was above 25 kω. other mice were pair-matched based on weight, after which they were randomly allocated (1:1) to the sham or stim group. the sham group counted 14 mice and the stimulated group counted 16 mice. bipolar stimulation was performed for 2 min 6 times daily for 12 days with the following parameters: 650 μamp, 10 hz, pulse width 200 μs (fig. 1a) (guyot et al. 2019) . proper stimulation was examined by observing behavioral changes of the mice (e.g. altered breathing, decreased movements). also, before, during, and after the experiment, impedance measurements (using a single frequency of 1 khz) with a minirator mr pro (nti audio, essen, germany) on the cuff electrodes were performed to ensure proper conduction. further, the vagus nerves with cuffs from randomly selected mice were collected. after paraffin embedding, a hematoxylin-eosin (he) staining was conducted to assess damage of the nerve. at the end of the study, mice were euthanized. all animals were treated with dextran sodium sulphate (dss) to induce acute colitis. 2.25% (w/v) dss (tdb consultancy, uppsala, sweden) was added to the drinking water for 5 consecutive days. drinking water with fresh dss solution was replaced daily. following dss-treatment, mice received normal drinking water for 7 days, adding up to a total experiment length of 12 days. during the study, bodyweight and behavior were monitored daily. vns was started at the same day as dss treatment. mrna was extracted from frozen ileal and colonic tissue after lysis in isolate ii rna lysis buffer rly and isolation according to the bioline isolate ii rna mini kit (both gc biotech b.v. alphen a/d rijn, the netherlands) and cdna was synthesized by use of the revertaid first strand cdna synthesis kit (thermofisher scientific, landsmeer, the netherlands). qpcr was performed using sensifast sybr no-rox (gc biotech b.v.) on a cfx96 touch™ real-time pcr detection system (bio-rad laboratories b.v., veenendaal, the netherlands) and expression levels were analyzed using linregpcr software (ruijter et al. 2009 ). expression levels were normalized for reference genes eef2, nono, and gapdh for mouse and actb, psmb6, and rplp0 for human after stability assessment with genorm ( vandesompele et al. 2002) . primers (all sigma-aldrich chemie n.v., zwyndrecht, the netherlands) are listed in table 1 . graphs were made with graphpad prism 8.0 (graphpad software, la jolla, ca, usa) and a mann-whitney u test (2 groups) or a kruskal-wallis test (> 2 groups) was used to check for statistical significance. in all tests, p < 0.05 was accepted as an indication for statistical significance. all data are expressed as median with interquartile range plus the individual data points. ace2 and tmprss2 co-express with nachrs in stem cells, goblet cells, and enterocytes we first investigated which cells express ace2 and tmprss2 in the human intestinal context. to this end, we obtained the data from gse134809 including singlecell rna-sequencing on inflamed and uninflamed ileal biopsies from patients with crohn's disease (martin et al. 2019) . unsupervised clustering analysis identified 22 clusters (fig. 2a) , with clusters 8, 11, 13, 14, and 18 likely representing the epithelial cells based on their expression of e-cadherin (cdh1) and villin-1 (vil1) (fig.  2b and c) . expectedly, both ace2 and tmprss2 were expressed in the same clusters confirming specific gene expression in epithelial cells in ileum. subsequent clustering analysis of the epithelial cells yielded 15 subclusters (fig. 2d) , in which we identified stem cells (lgr5, ascl2, olfm4, gkn3, slc12a2, axin2), goblet cells (muc2, tff3, clca3, agr2), enterocytes (fabp1, alpi, apoa1, apoa4), enteroendocrine cells (chga, chgb, tac1, tph1, neurog3), and tuft cells (dclk1, trpm5, gfi1b, il25) (fig. 2e) (haber et al. 2017; grun et al. 2015) . visualizing the expression of ace2 or tmprss2 alongside the expression of the nachr genes revealed co-expression in stem cells, goblet cells, and enterocytes for chrna5, chrna7, chrna10, chrnb1, and chrne (encoding nachr subunits α5, α7, α10, β1, and ε, respectively) (fig. 2f) . notably, ace2 is clearly expressed in goblet cells, although it has been demonstrated that sars-cov and sars-cov-2 cannot infect goblet cells in both airway and intestinal epithelia (lamers et al. 2020) . moreover, the nachr that was mostly co-expressed with ace2 and tmprss2 was α7 nachr (encoded by chrna7). this is an essential regulator of inflammation by inhibiting cytokine release through the aforementioned cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (wang et al. 2003) . this is relevant because russo and leung reported on the role of α7 nachr in sars-cov-2 and demonstrated that smoking results in an upregulation of α7 nachr leading to an increase of ace2 (leung et al. 2020a; russo et al. 2020; leung et al. 2020b) .  as a positive correlation of ace2 and chrna7 was previously observed, and chronic cholinergic stimulation typically leads to upregulation of nachrs, we investigated whether chronic vns affected the expression of ace2 (leung et al. 2020b; melroy-greif et al. 2016 ). accordingly, intestinal ileal tissues of mice that were subjected to electrical chronic vns, applied via an implantable device, were obtained and analyzed for ace2 mrna expression. adequate vns was confirmed by behavioral changes of the mice, impedance measurements, and he stainings not showing any damage of the vagus nerve caused by the cuff electrodes (fig. 3) . our data and stimulated animals (n = 16). levels were corrected for reference genes and epithelial markers e-cadherin (cdh1) and villin (vil1) to obtain epithelial fraction. b relative mrna expression of ace2 in human ileum (left) and colon (right) samples of patients treated with vns. levels were corrected for reference genes and epithelial markers e-cadherin (cdh1) and villin (vil1) to obtain epithelial fraction. mrna levels of ace2 were assessed in biopsies collected prior to vns, and 6 and 12 months after start vns. non-responders (red) are patients with no clinical and endoscopic remission. ace2: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; vns: vagus nerve stimulation show no effect on ace2 expression levels. since samples contained bulk rna of intestine, values were corrected for epithelial markers cdh1 and vil1 to determine the epithelial fraction. also after correction, no differences were observed (fig. 4a) . next, we assessed ace2 mrna expression in human intestinal tissues of patients treated with chronic vns as was described previously (bonaz et al. 2016; sinniger et al. 2020) . in line with the mouse data, no differential expression was observed between samples collected prior to vns and 6 and 12 months after start vns. correction for cdh1 and vil1, markers that have shown to be stable under inflammatory conditions (data not shown), did not alter the results (fig. 4b) . though not significant, a trend towards higher levels of ace2 at 12 months vns could be detected. noticeably, ace2 expression levels in colon samples were relatively low when compared with ileal samples, which is corroborated by earlier literature showing low basal expression levels of ace2 in colonic tissue (qi et al. 2020) . it should be mentioned that in this study we made use of already available tissues. thus, stimulation parameters such as duration of stimulation, pulse width, and frequency were not optimized for the current research question. in addition, both vns experiments have been performed in diseased subjects; mice were exposed to dss inducing colitis, and all humans had active crohn's disease. ace2 has been shown to be upregulated in inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), and in ileum in particular (hashimoto et al. 2012; bangma et al. 2020; krzysztof et al. 2020) . for that reason, in our experiments, basal ace2 expression levels might have been higher when compared with healthy subjects because of the colitis background of the tissues, possibly mitigating the results. the considerable divergence between ileal and colonic expression levels substantiates this confounding effect. though, our analyses did not show significant differences between uninflamed and inflamed samples (fig. 4b) . data on the role of α7 nachrs in colitis are conflicting. sun et al. demonstrated increased chrna7 expression upon 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (tnbs)induced colitis, whereas baird et al. found decreased chrna7 expression in ibd (baird et al. 2016; sun et al. 2007) . further, in an experimental colitis model, selective α7 nachr agonists worsened disease (snoek et al. 2010) . these data imply that colitis is associated with chrna7 expression, again modifying the ace2 expression levels perchance confusing the current results. importantly, when in this manuscript we focus on nicotinic receptors and α7 nachr specifically, it is important to note that other receptors might play a role in regulating ace2 as well since vns unequivocally activates other acetylcholine-binding receptor types. this was not examined in this study. in addition, we show that vns does not alter intestinal ace2 mrna expression levels. protein expression levels, which might be of more importance in this context, have not been assessed. hence, an effect on sars-cov-2 infection could still be observed. this is substantiated by lamers et al. who demonstrated that sars-cov-2 infection of gut enterocytes is independent from the ace2 expression level (lamers et al. 2020) . conversely, since sars-cov-2 is known to downregulate ace2 expression, it is plausible that vns could restore ace2 levels in infected patients (glowacka et al. 2010; kuba et al. 2005) . to this end, vns studies including sars-cov-2 infected patients should be performed. regardless of the ace2 expression level, the antagonizing effect of vns on the devastating systemic cytokine storm might strengthen this intervention as potential treatment for covid-19. this is greatly underlined by the positive outcomes of the recovery trial studying the effect of low-dose steroid treatment with dexamethasone on sars-cov-2 (recovery collaborative group et al. 2020). alike vns, dexamethasone is acknowledged as inhibitor of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (horton and remick 2010; nyhlen et al. 2004) . concerning the effect of vns on systemic cytokine responses, a critical note is that these responses depend on the stimulation parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and pulse width as was demonstrated by tsaava et al., and recently reviewed (tsaava et al. 2020; bonaz 2020) . although low frequency stimulation (as was used in our studies) was not examined, stimulation with high amplitudes resulted in an increase in il-6 and decrease in il-5 and tnf-α. when refining these parameters in vns, the subsequent positive regulation of cytokines could substantiate the role of vns in treating covid-19. finally, granting the potential role for vns in sars-cov-2 infection, one must be aware that parasympathetic neuronal activity through the vagus nerve can induce bronchoconstriction, an absolutely undesirable adverse effect in covid-19 patients (belmonte 2005) . even though results on this matter are conflicting, application of vns in these patients must be performed with great caution (miner et al. 2012; steyn et al. 2013) . to elucidate and overcome this issue, future studies should focus on more specific stimulation techniques exclusively targeting the cytokine-producing organ of interest. the implication of vns as treatment for sars-cov-2 infection has gained high interest. here, we show that despite gene co-expression of nachrs, ace2, and tmprss2 in the intestinal epithelium, chronic noninvasive electrical vns does not significantly alter intestinal ace2 expression at a transcriptional level. as bio-electronic neuromodulatory techniques continue to evolve as treatment for controlling inflammation, and with the current sars-cov-2 outbreak for covid-19 in particular, further experimental investigations are needed to shed light on the therapeutic potential of vns for sars-cov-2 infection control.
respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), acute lower respiratory tract infection, and lung cancer [1] , are among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. according to who, about 339 million people suffer from asthma [2] . copd was responsible for about 3.17 million deaths in 2015, and in 2016, about 251 million people were affected by this disease [3] . cystic fibrosis, another respiratory disease, also called bronchiectasis, affects about 30,000 people in the us [4] . shortness of breath, stubborn cough, wheezing, chest pain are typical symptoms of respiratory diseases [5] . the covid-19 pandemic, first identified in late 2019, is also a respiratory disease [6] that has already claimed over 1 million lives worldwide. early detection of symptoms such as respiratory distress can be vital in tracking various respiratory diseases, including the covid-19 pandemic. early diagnosis is critical in effectively treating most respiratory diseases, including copd and asthma [7] . spirometry is the most commonly used test for an initial respiratory assessment of a patient. confirmatory diagnosis of various respiratory disorders may require additional examination such as a chest x-ray or other laboratory tests. it is well known that shortness of breathing affects the human speech production mechanism [8] and, in theory, respiratory distress should be detectable from the speech signal analysis alone. thus, automatic initial assessment of respiratory function from speech can be valuable in low-resource settings where there is a lack of experienced general practitioners. previous work on speech signal analysis for respiratory assessment has been minimal. relevant research in this area includes the detection of breathing sound [9] , wheezing [10] and cough [11] . in [12] , methods are presented for estimating and visualizing the breathing pattern from speech recordings. although the authors claim that the system can be used for detecting pathological conditions, only healthy volunteer data were used for evaluation. in [13] , the authors introduced "spirocall", a method of performing spirometry using standard telephone calls. this method uses a 3d printed whistle and transmits the breathing effort's sound via the telephone channel. although the method is promising, it still requires a 3d printed device and the presence of trained personnel to be effective. in this work, we present our preliminary findings on detecting respiratory distress (or shortness of breath) from conversational telephone speech. voice recordings were collected from a telemedicine provider while the patient's personal identifying information was removed. we hypothesized that respiratory distress would affect the speech sound and rhythm and therefore utilized a set of acoustic and prosodic features for classification between patients having respiratory distress and healthy subjects.  speech production involves airflow from the lungs through the larynx, vocal cord vibration, and resonance in the oral and nasal cavities. since the lung is a vital organ for speech production, and respiratory disease is expected to cause physical changes in the speech production pathway and affect speech signal itself [14] . previous research [15] shows that the lung volumes and breathing patterns during speech differ from quiet respiration, and alterations in speech breathing are disease and task-specific. asthmatic patients tend to show an increased duration of silence between speech segments, lower syllable rates, and increased time in non-speech ventilatory activity [16] . thus, we can assume that respiratory distress will affect the speaking rate and speech breathing pattern [8] . in [17] , a high degree of correlation was found between fev1/fev ratio obtained from spirometry and harmonicsto-noise ratio (hnr) obtained from human speech for asthma patients. this motivates us to consider traditional acoustic features to analyze speech signals to detect respiratory distress symptoms. the speech recordings used for this study are collected from digital healthcare solutions (dhs), a leading telemedicine service provider in bangladesh 1 . the telemedicine service operates through direct phone calls between the patient and physicians. for this study, a total of 88 phone-call record- ings are collected. a patient's recordings were included if the patient called in to report suffering from respiratory distress. the speech recordings can be categorized into three classes: (i) patients reporting severe respiratory distress who are advised to visit a hospital urgently, (ii) patients reporting mild respiratory distress and generally have a history of breathing difficulty, (iii) healthy control subjects. the data is summarized in table 1 . patients included in (i) and (ii) may have a chronic condition such as asthma. however, our study's goal is to detect the condition of respiratory distress (or shortness of breath), not the actual disease. for this reason, the disease information is not used for our analysis even if it is available for some patients. the recordings are collected at a sampling rate of 44.1 khz. every telemedicine phonecall consists of the speech of the patient (or their representative, e.g., relative or guardian) and the physician. the recordings also contain occasional cough and wheezing sounds from the patient or other background noise. accordingly, the audio recordings are annotated in these 6 categories: (i) patient, (ii) doctor, (iii) patient representative, (iv) cough sound, (v) wheezing sound, and (vi) background noise. a typical annotated phonecall recording is shown in fig. 2 including some of these audio events. the total number of annotated recordings from all categories is 4522 as summarized in table 2 . in this work, only male patients are considered. the age of the patients range between 25 -65. a total of 1957 utterances (table 1 ) of different lengths were prepared for cross-validation experiments. the entire 1957 segmented speech signals are distributed into 3 folds for cross-validation (fig 3) . the train-test split for each fold is reserved to be approximately 70-30. we ensure that the same patient data is not used for both training and test so that the algorithms do not learn to recognize the speakers. the telephone calls typically include background noise and a static hum due to the recording instrument. therefore, before feature extraction, we performed a speech enhancement operation to reduce the background noise. the step is a pre-requisite for the extraction of the prosodic feature set. we use the vad approach presented in [18] as provided in the matlab voicebox toolkit [19] . we use the interspeech 2010 paralinguistic challange feature set proposed in [20] . the feature set contains 38 lowlevel descriptors (llds) and 21 functionals yielding a total of 1582 acoustic features [21] as summarized in table 3 . the llds are extracted at 100 frames per second with a diverse set of short-time windows and smoothed by simple moving average low-pass filtering with a window length of 3 frames. afterward, the first-order regression coefficients are calculated followed by the 21 functionals for every instance in the dataset [21] . these features are extracted using the opens-mile toolkit [22] . we only utilize speaking rhythm related features in this work. the following four (4) llds are computed: (i) voice rate, (ii) voice duration, (iii) pause duration, and (iv) voice & pause ratio. a window size of 1 sec is used and 21 functionals (as in sec. 4.3.1) are calculated to obtain an 84 dimensional feature set. the extracted features have a high dynamic range and thus a normalization step is necessary for effective classification [23] . in this study, we use standard mean and variance normalization for each feature. normalization of both training and test features is done for each fold using the mean and variance calculated from the training data of the corresponding fold. the svm classifer has been used for training the dataset with binary decision using the libsvm [24] tool. the two classes include (i) distressed, and (ii) normal. the "distress" class contains data of patients who reported having mild or severe respiratory distress. the "normal" class contains the speech segments of healthy control subjects. a linear kernel is used for the svm model with a fixed seed for every fold to ensure the results are reproducible.  the proposed method's performance is evaluated with respect to the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, f1-score, and auc (area under the curve of roc) for each fold. the mean and standard deviation of each performance metric is calculated from the folds. the acoustic and prosodic feature sets are first evaluated separately. in the final stage, the feature sets are fused by concatenation, and correlation-based feature reduction is performed to reduce the feature dimension to 251. the results are summarized in table 4 . from the result, we observe that for acoustic features, the classifier shows a mean accuracy of 86.4 (±2.1)% with the best sensitivity, specificity, f1 score, and auc. the acoustic features have consistent performance across the 3 folds, including identical auc values indicating the subject/patient invariance of the classifier. compared to the acoustic features, the prosodic features performed were sub-par. this feature set resulted in an accuracy of only 56.5 (±2.5)%, which slightly better than a random classifier. the fusion of the features and feature selection did not provide any significant improvement in the overall performance. to correlate individual features' performance to the physiological aspects of speech production, we combined the acoustic and prosodic feature sets and performed a correlationbased feature ranking. the analysis returned 251 top-ranked features, including 242 acoustic features and 9 prosodic features. to simplify the study, we look at the lld features included among the top 251 features and provide the rankings of the top 10 llds in table 5 . we observe that features that can be physiologically connected to respiratory distress are included, such as loudness, voice rate, voice duration, pause duration. loudness is the most prominent feature in detecting respiratory distress. spectral and cepstral features are also found to be important in the ranking analysis, confirming our hypothesis that voice quality can be altered due to respiratory distress (e.g., increased hoarseness).  this study presented findings from our preliminary analysis on respiratory distress detection from telephone speech collected from real telemedicine phonecalls from actual patients reporting adverse health conditions. we have utilized a set of acoustic and prosodic features for binary classification between a patient reporting respiratory distress and a healthy control subject. experimental results using the proposed feature set and an svm classifier showed promising results achieving above 85% performance in all of the performance metrics, namely, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f-1 score, on a 3-folds cross-validation experiment. the topranked features obtained by correlation analysis were found to be physiologically meaningful. the proposed method can significantly impact the automatic early detection of respiratory diseases through telemedicine phonecalls in low-resource settings. a further large-scale clinical study is required to confirm the diagnostic usability of the proposed approach.
cells are internally compartmentalised. this allows proteins and lipids that participate in the same biochemical pathways to have higher local concentrations. additionally, compartmentalisation segregates proteins that could potentially damage other cellular components (eg. proteases). this system is maintained by the trafficking of lipids and proteins in vesicles within the cell. vesicles bud from a 'donor' compartment and translocate across the cytosol to fuse with a 'receiver' compartment, a process orchestrated by the membrane trafficking machinery. membrane trafficking allows delivery of nascently biosynthesised proteins and lipids to the plasma membrane. approximately 11-15% of human proteins are secreted as soluble proteins to the extracellular space [1] [2] [3] and an additional 10% localise to the plasma membrane [4] . this represents over 3500 proteins with a vast array of functions, including antibodies, signalling molecules, and integral endomembrane proteins which traffic to the plasma membrane before being internalised to the endolysosomal system. secreted proteins are not only numerous, but abundant, with the secreted protein collagen family accounting for 30% of total protein mass in mammals [5] . this review will focus on the trafficking route and machinery required to deliver proteins from the golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. the fundamental principles of protein secretion were established during the early days of protein trafficking, by the pioneering work of george palade. to track the intracellular biosynthetic routes, palade used the highly secretory pancreatic exocrine cells, which accumulate proteins in zymogen granules before their regulated secretion [6] . using analytical centrifugation and pulsechase autoradiography, palade demonstrated the fundamental principle that protein sorting is sequential and vectorial. later studies on the trafficking of immunoglobulin, a model secreted protein which traffics directly from the golgi to the plasma membrane, identified the "smooth vesicles" or "secretory vacuoles" that contain this protein [7, 8] . it was also realised, around the same time, that there were two different forms of secretion: constitutive (i.e. continuous) and regulated (i.e. upon stimulation) secretion. both forms of secretion can occur in the same cell [9, 10] and segregation between the two routes happens in the trans-golgi network [11] . in this review we focus on the constitutive secretory route that is found in the vast majority of eukaryotic cells. it soon became clear that specialised cells, such as endocrine cells and neurons, are able to secrete a subset of proteins from a preferred portion of the plasma membrane. this process was later defined as polarised secretion [9, 12] . this theory was formed from multiple lines of evidence including the polarised distribution of proteins in electron micrographs [13] [14] [15] , immunoisolation of synaptic vesicles identifying specific proteins localised to polarised carriers [16] , imaging studies tracking directional trafficking of organelles in the axons of squids [17] [18] [19] , and secretion of viral proteins in polarised epithelial cells [20] [21] [22] . to identify the fundamental machinery of the secretory process, the laboratory of randy schekman performed a genetic screen in yeast [23] . secretory mutants in yeast accumulate proteins and membrane intracellularly, making the cells denser. these mutant yeast would therefore differentially sediment from wild-type yeast on density gradients. this principle was employed to screen the yeast genome for mutants of the secretory system. to perform this screen they used 'temperature sensitive' (ts) mutants. ts mutants result in temperature dependent protein instability. proteins with ts mutations fold properly in a 'permissive' temperature, but when the temperature is shifted they misfold, thus revealing the phenotype of protein loss. this allowed a set of 23 complementation groups (sec1-23) to be discovered in what was called the sec screen [23] . one of the major findings from this screen was the copii protein complex that allows for endoplasmic reticulum (er) to golgi transport. along with rothman's work [24, 25] , this landmark study identified the first genes encoding the machinery involved in protein trafficking and secretion. at this point, however, the route from the early secretory system to the plasma membrane and the machinery involved was still not understood. in efforts to understand the principle of protein sorting and secretion, the 'bulk flow' hypothesis was formally proposed [9, 26] . the 'bulk flow' model states that secretion from the er through the golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane does not require a signal and happens in 'bulk' by default. the first hints at this hypothesis came from the secretion of bacterial β-lactamase after microinjection of the rna into xenopus oocytes [27] . subsequently, bulk peptide secretion was demonstrated by monitoring glycosylation and secretion of exogenously added peptides to mammalian cell lines and detecting their arrival at the cell surface [26] . a subset of the secreted peptides were glycosylated indicating they had been transported through the golgi apparatus. the conclusion was that these peptides were secreted in bulk by default. in the following years there were a number of studies that questioned the generality of this hypothesis. most of these studies focussed on the er export of membrane spanning proteins rather than the golgi to plasma membrane route. studies on soluble proteins reported increased concentration of secreted proteins as they are trafficked to the plasma membrane, suggesting that they are actively sorted. concentrative transport of soluble proteins, however, was thought to be due to selective removal of other cargo rather than active sorting, supporting the idea that there is no selective transport on the soluble cargo itself [28, 29] . there are a subset of soluble proteins that are actively sorted from the er, such as gpi anchored proteins which are sorted by the p24 protein family [30] and proteins including cathepsin c [31] , cathepsin z [32] , factor v, and factor viii [33] which require the ergic-53/lman1 receptor. it is generally agreed, however, that the default fate of soluble proteins without any known signal is to be secreted. soluble protein secretion has been demonstrated to be highly efficient. in yeast, induction of secretion of acid phosphatase with a temperature shift indicates a six-fold increase in secreted protein with almost no detectable increase in intracellular levels [34] . studies in plants demonstrated that 50-90% of synthesised soluble proteins are delivered to the extracellular space [35, 36] , consistent with studies in mammalian cells [37] . a quantitative study on the secretion of a soluble non-glycosylated protein found that after synthesis and folding the fastest molecules are secreted in about 15 mins with the half-life of secretion being 40 mins [38] . the resulting consensus for soluble secreted proteins is that transport is not signal-mediated, relatively fast and follows a default bulk flow pathway from the golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. the 'default' route of integral membrane proteins is more complicated as there are multiple sorting signals and protein topologies. as discussed above there are two membrane trafficking steps to arrive at the plasma membrane: from the er to the golgi and from the golgi to the plasma membrane. following the proposal of the bulk-flow hypothesis, a number of groups demonstrated that er export of transmembrane proteins is at least somewhat signal-mediated [36, [39] [40] [41] . after arrival at the golgi, membrane proteins need to sort to their final destination. transport from the golgi apparatus was hypothesised to be selectively mediated by clathrin after the discovery of the ap-1 clathrin adaptor complex [42] [43] [44] . studies using a type-i membrane-spanning protein, the cation-independent mannose-6 phosphate receptor (ci-mpr), demonstrated that mutations in the cytoplasmic terminus cause retention in the golgi apparatus [45] . it was later shown that monomeric gga clathrin adaptors also play a role at the golgi apparatus and are essential for export of ci-mpr [46, 47] . therefore, there are two clathrin adaptor complexes at the golgi which selectively sort cargo in a signal mediated manner. there are also trafficking routes for integral membrane proteins from the golgi apparatus, independent of cytoplasmic signals. the mechanism of golgi retention was investigated by making a series of chimeras made of two integral membrane proteins: a golgi localised protein (β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (gt)) and an endosomal protein (human invariant chain (ii)) [48] . a chimera with the transmembrane domain of gt and the cytoplasmic and lumenal domain of ii is retained in the golgi, demonstrating that the transmembrane domain alone can mediate golgi localisation [48] . similarly, chimeras of the transmembrane domain of the golgi-localised α-2,6sialyltransferase (st) with the cell surface protein dipeptidylpeptidase iv (dppiv) are golgi retained [49] . st fusions with the transmembrane domain replaced with either 17 or 23 leucines localises to the golgi apparatus and plasma membrane respectively. this effect was only observed, however, when the lumenal domain of st was also in the chimera [49, 50] . additionally, a type-i membrane protein (cd8) with a transmembrane domain of 23 leucine residues accumulates on the plasma membrane, whereas the same fusion with 17 leucines accumulates on the golgi apparatus [50] . the relationship between transmembrane domain length and localisation was also analysed using temperature sensitive vsv-g (described in section 4, below) [51] . a 7 amino acid truncation of the transmembrane domain of vsv-g causes less efficient golgi export. the e1 glycoprotein from an avian coronavirus localises to the golgi apparatus in mammalian cells [52] . the e1 glycoprotein is a triple-pass transmembrane protein (with the c-terminus in the cytoplasm). replacing the transmembrane domain of vsv-g with the first transmembrane domain of e1 mislocalises vsv-g to the golgi apparatus [53] . another example, from plants, is the vacuolar transmembrane protein α-tip which accumulates on the vacuolar membrane of tobacco leaf cells despite deletion of the cytosolic terminus [54] . truncations of the transmembrane domain of α-tip resulted in protein accumulation at the golgi. this suggests that the length of the transmembrane domain is a determining factor for post-golgi sorting, a finding supported by other studies in plants [36, 55] . these observations were further corroborated in mammals by comparing the length of an extensive list of over 1000 single-pass membrane proteins with a known localisation. proteins known to reside on the plasma membrane have, on average, a longer hydrophobic section when compared to golgi localised proteins [56] . in summary, by the early 1990's the general rules of protein trafficking had been discovered. it was clear that proteins sort in a controlled way to various subcellular localisations. the studies above established a series of fundamental principles including: the binding of cytoplasmic adaptors to transmembrane cargos, the default secretion of soluble proteins and that membrane proteins do not have a 'default' route. proteins that enter the secretory system can be identified by a number of signals. soluble proteins and type-i integral membrane proteins have a signal peptide on their n-terminus, type-ii integral membrane proteins have a stop-transfer signal to allow c-terminal insertion into the er, and multipass proteins have a combination of signal peptide and stop-transfers depending on the topology of the transmembrane domains. once in the er, the proteins fold due to an array of atpase chaperones, the most characterised of which is bip. the chaperones bind to unfolded hydrophobic portions of the protein and expend atp to allow proper folding. the last step before export to the golgi apparatus is the covalent addition of glycans [57] . there are two key processes happening in the golgi stacks: proteins are progressively further glycosylated [58] and then sorted to their steady-state destination in the cell. within the golgi apparatus proteins are sorted into different domains [59] [60] [61] [62] to be trafficked to at least four distinct locations ( fig.1 ). one subset of proteins return in copi vesicles back to the er. this includes the soluble resident er chaperones that are 'rescued' from the cis golgi stacks by the kdel receptor, to allow steady-state localisation in the er [63, 64] . a second subset includes the golgi resident enzymes that are retained in the golgi apparatus [65] . these golgi resident enzymes are thought to be retained by a combination of active sorting and oligomerisation (reviewed: [65] ). the third subset traffic in clathrin-coated vesicles from the golgi apparatus. these vesicles traffic directly to the endolysosomal system and contain lysosomal hydrolases and their receptors [59] . this process is mediated by the clathrin monomeric gga adaptors and ap-1 complex which bind to both a motif in the cytosolic termini of the transmembrane cargos and accessory proteins present on the trans-golgi [66] . the final subset of proteins leave the golgi apparatus and traffic directly to the plasma membrane. this pathway and these carriers are the focus of this review. the trans-golgi network was proposed to be the point at which cargos leave the golgi apparatus [11] based on the observation of budding structures in electron micrographs [67] . to understand what machinery was involved in the formation of these membrane carriers budding from the golgi, the well-characterised clathrin-mediated transport seemed an obvious candidate to investigate. clathrin carriers range from the typical spherical 60-100 nm clathrin-coated vesicles to larger, up to 1200 nm in size, grape-like structures displaying several coated buds [68] . the clathrin coat and its accessory protein complex, ap-1, was also shown to drive the formation of weibel-palade bodies, large cigar-shaped secretory organelles produced by endothelial cells which can be up to 5 μm long [69, 70] . it has been proposed that the diverse array of carrier morphologies could be an adaptive mechanism for a variety cargo size or abundance. in the same line, copii coat, which mediates cargo transport from the er to the golgi apparatus, can adopt more flexible conformations than the conventional 80 nm copii carriers and assemble into tubular structures [71] or even potentially compartment-to-compartment tunnels [72] to allow the transport of large cargos like procollagen. in addition, cargos could potentially also affect the architecture of the golgi. for example, overexpression of uroplakins, proteins that follow the conventional trafficking route from golgi to pm localising on the apical surface of urothelial cells, triggers the fragmentation of the golgi apparatus [73] . this effect suggests an adaptation of the cell in response to an increased flux of secretory proteins. although some clathrin adaptors such as ggas and ap1 associate to the cytosolic termini of transmembrane proteins at the trans-golgi, it was soon identified that a clathrin-dependent mechanism was unlikely to be involved in the secretory carriers. in fact, the secreted protein invertase was unaffected by deletion of the clathrin heavy chain in s. cerevisiae [74] . it was therefore established relatively early that the secretory carriers are probably not clathrin coated vesicles and perhaps completely independent of clathrin. in addition to the various clathrin carriers that bud from the golgi apparatus, there is a second class of carriers often referred to as a 'pleomorphic tubular-vesicular carriers'. these are lipid tubules and vesicles that bud from the golgi apparatus, and are heterogeneous in size and shape in contrast to a clathrin-coated vesicle, which are generally geometrically constrained by the clathrin lattice. in contrast, pleomorphic tubular-vesicular carriers that traffic from the golgi apparatus directly to the plasma membrane seem devoid of coat [75] . studies on temperature sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) mutant strains revealed a subset which had a mutation in the envelope 'g' protein of the virus. this protein has incomplete glycosylation at the nonpermissive temperature [76] , and was shown by cellular fractionation to localise at a different site in the cell depending on the temperature [77] . cells infected with the temperature sensitive mutant strain retain the g protein in the er and, upon temperature shift, traffic the protein towards the pm [78] . this effect is recapitulated with overexpression of a cdna clone of the mutant protein [79] allowing for an ectopically expressed tsvsv-g that misfolds and accumulates in the er at the 'non-permissive' temperature of 40°c. accumulated tsvsv-g is released en masse when the cells are shifted to the permissive temperature. this en masse export allows observation of tsvsv-g as it traffics to the plasma membrane, either biochemically or by imaging fluorophore j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f fusions. visualisation of tsvsv-g-gfp as it buds from the golgi revealed tubular carriers that bud from the golgi apparatus and traffic to the plasma membrane [80, 81] . these post-golgi carriers were described to be large pleomorphic tubular structures which traffic directly to the plasma membrane with an average carrier containing ∼10,000 tsvsv-g-gfp molecules [81, 82] . these are likely not artifacts of an overloaded secretory system as they traffic along microtubules and fuse with the plasma membrane, demonstrating that cellular machinery exists to sort these carriers [81, 83] . later studies suggested that tsvsv-g traffics to the plasma membrane indirectly via recycling endosomes [84, 85] . whether tsvsv-g traffics via the indirect or direct route to the plasma membrane is likely to be dependent on cell type, analogous to the indirect and direct trafficking routes of the lysosomal protein lamp1 [59, 86, 87] . correlative light-electron microscopy imaging of the carriers revealed that they are 0.3-1.7 μm [80] , a factor larger than typical clathrin coated vesicles, which are approximately between 0.06 and 0.1 μm [88] . these carriers were demonstrated to form en bloc, rather than by fusion of multiple smaller vesicular structures [75] . these initial observations set the stage for understanding the machinery that mediates this process. unlike other cellular pathways, such as clathrin coated vesicles [88] , or retromer recycling carriers [89] , there is still no clear consensus for the machinery and molecular processes that drive the formation, budding, translocation and fusion of post-golgi to plasma membrane carriers. there are, however, a number of candidate machineries that play a role in this process. we have detailed these below (see overview in figure 2). arf1, an extensively studied small gtpase of the arf family, has a well-established role in copi vesicle biogenesis at the golgi [90] . arf1 is also important in the budding of a large variety of other coated vesicles, recruiting adaptor protein complexes like ap1, ap3, ap4 as well as gga, and exomer complexes [91, 92] . arf1 forms a dimer in its gtp-bound form which is crucial to induce positive membrane curvature in vitro [93] . a mutant of arf1 that is unable to dimerise is not able to induce copi vesicle formation. arf1, therefore, seems to induce membrane bending by forming a dimer in order to generate vesicles. this property of arf1 prompted rothman's laboratory to investigate its role in the generation of golgi-derived tubules [94] . halo-tagged arf1 was imaged at endogenous expression levels with super-resolution imaging and, only under these conditions (not by over-expression of arf1) arf1 labels transient tubular carriers emerging from the golgi. arf1 gtpase activity is required for the formation of these tubular carriers. there are at least two distinct populations of arf1-containing tubules. a subset of these tubules, containing vsv-g, traffic along microtubules in an anterograde direction towards the cell periphery. arf1 positive carriers, however, were not observed fusing directly to the plasma membrane implying that they either lose arf1 before fusion or there is an additional trafficking step [94] . arf1, cortactin and dynamin 2 can be detected on isolated golgi membranes from a sucrose gradient. incubating these membranes with the arf1 inhibitor brefeldin a (bfa) causes loss of arf1, cortactin and dynamin 2 from the membranes, which can be inhibited by supplementation with gtp-loaded arf1 [95] . imaging experiments show addition of brefeldin a causes loss of cortactin and dynamin 2 from the golgi, suggesting that arf1 is able to recruit actin, cortactin and dynamin 2 to the trans-golgi. finally, the expression of truncated cortactin proteins decreases the efficiency of tsvsv-g export from the tgn towards the cell surface. cortactin promotes the formation of branched actin polymers through interactions with the arp2/3 complex [96] , and dynamin 2 is a small gtpase essential for membrane fission [97] . these findings show the importance of arf1 in the recruitment of an actin/cortactin/dynamin 2 complex essential for post-golgi transport. two binding partners of arf1, pkd (serine/threonine-protein kinase d, human gene isoforms: prkd1-3) and fapp2 (encoded by the gene plekha8), are also associated with post-golgi tubular carriers [98, 99] . addition of the metabolite ilimaquinone causes golgi fragmentation by activating pkd through stimulation of a heterotrimeric g protein (gβγ) [100] . an inactive mutant of pkd, expressed at moderate levels in a stable hela cell line at 20°c, inhibits protein transport from the trans-golgi to the cell surface by causing golgi tubulation [101] . cargo destined for the plasma membrane like tsvsv-g are trapped in large tubules that remain attached to the tgn. similarly, depletion of prkd2 and prkd3 (human homologs of pkd) by sirna also inhibits tgnto-cell surface transport and shows cargo accumulation in large tubules [102] . these results strongly suggest that pkd is required for membrane fission at the trans-golgi of carriers destined for the cell surface. pkd has two cysteine-rich domains at the n-terminus, one interacts with diacylglycerol and the second one with arf1 [103, 104] . the direct interaction of pkd2 with arf1 is enhanced when the small gtpase is in its active conformation [104] . pkd is activated by gβγ to stimulate specific lipid kinases like the enzyme pi(4)kiiiß [98, 100] . this promotes the production of pi(4)p, a crucial lipid that drives vesicle biogenesis at the tgn through a variety of mechanisms [105] -see also section 7 below. fapp1 and fapp2 were originally identified to bind specifically to pi(4)p through their ph domain [106, 107] . pull-down experiments with isolated golgi membranes and with recombinant proteins show a direct interaction of fapp proteins with arf1-gtp [107] . binding to both pi(4)p and arf1 allows fapp targeting to the trans-golgi via coincidence detection. it was proposed that fapp proteins are able to deform membranes [108] [109] [110] . recombinant fapp2, as well as the isolated ph domain of fapp1, are able to induce tubulation of membrane sheets in vitro [108, 110] . during imaging of synchronised transport of tsvsv-g, fapp proteins localise on tubular carriers emerging from the tgn [107] . knockdown of fapps by sirna inhibits cargo delivery to the plasma membrane, indicating that fapp proteins are essential for the constitutive post-golgi transport. furthermore, fapp2 is specifically involved in apical transport in polarised mdck cells [111] . fapp2 has a similar domain structure to fapp1 aside from an additional glycolipidtransfer-protein-homology domain at its c-terminus. fapp2 specifically transfers glucosylceramide (glccer) in vitro and this transfer is stimulated in the presence of pi(4)p and arf1 [112] . glccer is normally trans-golgi localised, however in fapp2 knock-down cells glccer is mislocalised to the cis-golgi. as glycer is a precursor for glycosphingolipids which are key components of the plasma membrane, this role of fapp2 connects tubule formation, pi(4)p generation, and subsequent fapp2 recruitment at the golgi with plasma membrane homeostasis. another binding partner of arf1 at the trans-golgi is the exomer complex [92, 113, 114] . to date, the exomer complex is the only known cargo adaptor involved in the direct transport of cargo from the tgn to the plasma membrane [92, 115, 116] . discovered in yeast, there is no obvious exomer homolog in metazoans. the exomer complex is a heterotetramer composed of two chs5 subunits and any two members of the four paralogous chs5-arf1 binding proteins (chaps), chs6, bud7, bch1, and bch2, which confer cargo specificity through direct binding to the cytoplasmic termini. structural studies reveal that the exomer complex binds two arf1 molecules [113] . by inserting a hydrophobic element into the membrane and coordinating the membrane insertion of two arf1 molecules, exomer amplifies arf1 membrane remodelling ability. thus, exomer participates in cargo sorting and membrane fission. in summary, arf1 has a key role in the formation of tsvsv-g enriched post-golgi tubular carriers by inducing membrane curvature and by recruiting a variety of binding partners such as lipid modifying enzymes, lipid transport proteins and fission promoting proteins. post-golgi carriers have also been observed using the "retention using selective hooks" (rush) system [59, 117] . by fusing a protein of interest to streptavidin-binding peptide (sbp) and coexpressing an er localised streptavidin, rush allows the protein of interest to accumulate in the er due to the interaction between the streptavidin and the sbp [118] . addition of exogenous biotin outcompetes the interaction between the sbp and streptavidin leaving the protein of interest free to traffic along its normal trafficking itinerary. by combining this approach with high-resolution microscopy to track the secretion of different endolysosomal proteins, lamp1 was shown to sort into distinct golgi domains when compared to the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor or sortillin [59] . lamp1 leaves the golgi in tubular carriers depending on the transmembrane and lumenal domains of lamp1 but independently of sorting signals in the cytosolic tail. finally, microscopy experiments show that lamp1 tubular carriers that contain transferrin receptor and vsv-g, fuse directly with the plasma membrane. rush of vsv-g shows that vsv-g concentrates in lamp1 carriers, suggesting that these carriers correspond to the tsvsv-g golgi-to-pm carriers discussed above. the route of endogenous lamp1 from the golgi remains controversial as immunoelectron microscopy studies suggest that a fraction of these nonclathrin coated lamp1 carriers travel instead directly to late endosomes and contain the hops component vps41 and the snare vamp7 which are both required for fusion [119] . in summary, the lysosomal protein lamp1 traffics on vsv-g enriched post-golgi tubular carriers to reach the cell surface before being recycled to the endolysosomal compartments. however, further investigations on this class of carriers is essential and will help determine if these carriers are the same as the arf1 positive carriers described above. rab6 was also found associated with about 50% of golgi-derived vesicles enriched with tsvsv-g together with neuropeptide y and bdnf which are secreted when overexpressed in hela cells [120] . tirf experiments show the direct fusion of these rab6 secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. furthermore, rab6 knockdown delays the secretion of vsv-g, implying a role of rab6 in the transport of the carriers to the cell periphery. the microtubule motors kinesin-1 (kif5b) and dynein are also important for the delivery of the carriers [120] . a few years later, an unexpected role of rab6 in the fission of these rab6 secretory carriers was highlighted [121] . long tubular carriers connected to the golgi and seemingly unable to detach have been observed by live cell imaging when cells are depleted of rab6a, or its isoform rab6a`. pulldown experiments show that rab6 interacts in vivo with myosin ii and the direct interaction was observed with purified proteins. inhibition or depletion of myosin ii in different cell types prevents the fission of rab6 secretory carriers which form long tubules connected to the golgi apparatus. therefore, myosin ii has an important role at the golgi in the fission step of secretory carriers. further investigations show that myosin ii works with f-actin filaments for vesicle fission since actin depolymerization leads to the formation of long tubules [121] . altogether, this work shows that rab6 is also associated with a subset tsvsv-g enriched post-golgi tubular carriers and unravels a novel function of rab gtpases in vesicle fission. the kinesin kif20a which interacts with rab6 and myosin ii, has a key role in the fission of rab6positive vesicles [122] . long golgi-attached rab6 positive tubules can be observed by light microscopy upon either addition of a specific chemical inhibitor of kif20a motor activity or depletion of kif20a by sirna. rab6 participates in the recruitment of kif20a to the golgi complex confining it to growing microtubules at 'golgi fission hotspots'. rab6 and kif20a recruit myosin ii which, together with actin, drive fission of rab6 secretory carriers. the carriers are then transported along microtubules towards the cell surface along microtubules due to the kinesin kif5b [120, 121] . rab6 secretory carriers transport a large variety of cargos. using the rush system, it was shown that rab6 secretory carriers contain the anterograde cargos cd59, tnfα, and colx and rab6 depletion delays the delivery of these cargo to the plasma membrane [117] . furthermore, rab6 depletion in embryonic fibroblast cells reduces global protein secretion by 50%. this together implies that rab6 is a major regulator of post-golgi secretion by regulating fission as detailed above. however, rab6 does not seem to be involved in cargo sorting. brefeldin a (bfa) is a small molecule originally isolated from fungi that has been demonstrated to inhibit the arf1 exchange factor, gbf1 [123] . as arf1 is essential to golgi structure and function, extended incubation with bfa leads to golgi disassembly [124] . while investigating the molecular factors involved in the golgi disassembly induced by bfa, the protein ctbp1-s/bars, also known as ctbp3/bars (c-terminus binding protein 3/bfa adenosine diphosphate-ribosylated substrate), was identified [125] . isolated golgi membranes are fragmented when incubated with either recombinant or rat brain purified ctbp1-s/bars [126] . co-incubation of ctbp1-s/bars on golgi membranes with various lipids demonstrated that ctbp1-s/bars acts as a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase to promote generation of phosphatidic acid on the membrane of the golgi. microinjection of ctbp1-s/bars increases the number of post-golgi carriers. tsvsv-g tgn-exit assays show that ctbp1-s/bars is recruited to the golgi and associates with tsvsv-g enriched post-golgi carriers [127] . microinjection of an anti-ctbp1-s/bars antibody or sirna experiments against ctbp1-s/bars blocks the delivery of tsvsv-g carriers to the plasma membrane, whereas inhibition of dynamin 2 has no detectable effect [128] . thus, ctbp1-s/bars is hypothesised to be essential for membrane fission in a dynamin 2 independent mechanism. as the small gtpase dynamin 2 has been shown to be essential for the fission of arf1 tubular carriers (section 5.1) and clathrin coated vesicles [129] , this is a novel cellular fission mechanism. 14-3-3γ and pi(4)kiiiβ co-immunoprecipitate with ctbp1-s/bars from rat brain cytosol [127] . the resulting complex is stabilised by phosphorylation by the kinases pkd and pak. ctbp1-s/bars subsequently activates lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase δ which produces phosphatidic acid, this process is essential to induce the fission of post-golgi carriers [130] . in summary, ctbp1-s/bars is a key component of a protein complex involving 14-3-3γ, pi(4)kiiiβ, pkd and pak, and has an essential role in the fission of tsvsv-g enriched post-golgi carriers. the importance of the lipid sphingomyelin (sm) for carrier formation was suggested while investigating lipid-raft formation at the golgi [131] , and confirmed by the identification of a new class of tgn-derived vesicles particularly enriched in that type of lipid [132] . sm, a principal component of the plasma membrane, is synthesised in the golgi apparatus and transported to the cell surface. a non-toxic reporter, eq-sm was used to monitor intracellular trafficking of sm along the biosynthetic pathway from the lumenal side of the membrane. proximity biotinylation identified new proteins associated with the sm secretory carriers [133] . eq-sm (or a control protein that does not bind sm) was fused to the promiscuous biotin ligase apex2 and expressed in hela cells. cells were permeabilized and incubated with rat liver cytosol and an atp regenerating system to generate golgi-derived vesicles. apex2-mediated biotinylation was then induced on vesicle fractions. biotin-labelled proteins were isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. sm-rich secretory vesicles contain lysozyme c and gpi-anchored proteins and are highly enriched in cab45 (calcium-binding protein 45), a lumenal golgi resident protein important for soluble cargo sorting in a calcium dependent manner [134, 135] . the golgi localised protein spca1 (secretory pathway calcium atpase 1), activated by its direct interaction with cofilin-1 and f-actin, pumps calcium into the tgn [134, 136, 137] . the lumenal flux of calcium triggers the oligomerisation of the soluble golgi localised protein, cab45 [134, 138] . as cab45 binds to certain secreted cargoes (eg. lysozyme c), in a calcium dependent manner, the oligomerisation leads to sorting into secretory carriers. interestingly, sirna experiments show that cab45 affects the export of endogenous cargos such as the cartilage oligomeric protein (comp) [134] . additionally, deletion of spca1 reduced the number of sm carriers [133] and rush assays show that secretion of lysozyme c containing vesicles are significantly reduced in spca1 null cells, which can be rescued by recovery of spca1. furthermore, spca1 associates with sm in golgi membranes and golgi calcium influx assays show that depletion of sm impairs the tgn calcium uptake by spca1. in summary, spca1 links sphingomyelin synthesis to calcium/cab45-dependent cargo sorting in the trans-golgi. lipoprotein lipase (lpl), identified in the proximity biotinylation experiment described above [133] , is also secreted in sm carriers [139] . lpl binds to syndecan-1 and gets co-secreted on smenriched secretory carriers. therefore, sdc1 acts as a sorting receptor for lpl at the trans-golgi and directs it into the secretory pathway. in summary, the packaging of specific secretory proteins into sm rich carriers is mediated by spca1 and the subsequent cab45 oligomerisation. whether these carriers are the same as others described here requires further investigation and experimentation. in a series of experiments purifying post-golgi carriers, a new class of secretory carriers named carts (carriers of the tgn to the cell surface) was discovered [140] . partial permeabilisation of hela cells and the use of an atp regenerating system allowed the formation and purification of post-golgi vesicles. isolation and analysis of these carriers indicate that carts are devoid of collagen and tsvsv-g but enriched in endogenous proteins such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor (pauf), lysozyme c, synaptotagmin ii (syt2), rab6a, and rab8a [140] . earlier experiments had shown that protein kinase d (pkd) was essential for forming tubular carriers at the trans-golgi [101] , as discussed in section 5.1. knock-down of pkd resulted in extended carts tubules from the golgi apparatus. furthermore, vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins (vap-a/b) regulate carts formation upstream of pkd [141] . interestingly, expression of an osbp construct (ph-ffat) which immobilises er-golgi contact sites, drastically reduced carts production and pauf secretion [141, 142] , suggesting a key role of er-golgi contact sites in the generation of post-golgi carriers. similarly, fapp1, localised at er-golgi contact sites, controls the level of pi(4)p at the trans-golgi and regulates the secretion of the endogenous cargo apob100 [143] . finally, the kinesin protein eg5, well known for its role in bipolar spindle assembly during mitosis, has a role in the transport of carts toward the cell surface along microtubules [144] . carts are distinct from copi, copii and clathrin carriers and are pleomorphic structures of 100 to 250 nm in diameter [140] . in summary, carts constitute a totally distinct class of carriers destined to the cell surface as they exclude tsvsv-g. however, several cargo proteins sorted by cab45 (like lysozyme c) are associated with carts [145] raising the question: how similar are these carriers to sm secretory carriers discussed above? further investigation is essential to fully understand what distinguishes these carriers from the other ones. the final event of a protein trafficking pathway is the fusion of the carrier with the distal compartment. this involves membrane tethering ('recognition') and membrane fusion to allow soluble content mixing and membrane delivery. in the case of the post-golgi carrier and the plasma membrane there are a number of candidate tethering factors (see summary in figure 3) , it is currently unclear if the machinery for carrier fusion is distinct for constitutive and regulated secretion. the large coiled-coil protein elks, also called cast2, rab6ip2, or erc1 [146] [147] [148] [149] , is involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis based on purification of highly exocytic synaptic junctions [150, 151] . tirf imaging in insulin-producing cells shows elks foci on the exocytic fusion pore, supporting a role in regulated secretion [152, 153] . elks was identified as a rab6 interactor [147] . an accumulation in rab6 positive vesicular structures was observed after elks depletion [120] , later shown to be positive for mical3 and rab8 [154] . mical3 and rab8 interact with each other and mical3 with elks, hinting at a functional complex for exocytosis. arhgef10, an exchange factor for rhoa has been shown to localise to rab6/rab8 positive carriers and is required for rab8 recruitment suggesting that there is a small g protein cascade leading to carrier fusion [155, 156] . the soluble biosynthetic cargo neuropeptide y accumulates in pre-fusion elks dependent carriers, suggesting that this is the biosynthetic transport route [120] . elks and rab6 are on plasma membrane 'hotspots' which are the fusion points of the secretory carriers [117] . another obvious candidate for the fusion of the carriers at the plasma membrane is the exocyst complex. exocyst is an octameric protein complex, with six of the subunits (sec6, sec8, sec15, sec3, sec5 and sec10) discovered in the original sec yeast genetic screen and later characterised as a complex [23, [157] [158] [159] . the remaining subunits (exo70 and exo84) were discovered subsequently as bona fide members of the complex [160] [161] [162] . exocyst is important for exocytic transport (hence the name exocyst) based on the localisation in budding yeast and the sec phenotype. in non-polarised mammalian cells exocyst components localise to the plasma membrane and golgi apparatus [163] . tsvsv-g colocalises with exocyst in the golgi stacks. it is not clear, however, if it colocalises to the post-golgi tsvsv-g carriers or at the fusion point of the carriers. exocyst inhibition with antibodies does not affect vsv-g delivery [163, 164] . sirna depletion of exo70 decreased the efficiency but did not completely stop tsvsv-g delivery [165] . colocalisation of tsvsv-g and sec8 on the plasma membrane using tirf microscopy showed only 20% overlap between the two markers [166] . to-date it is not clear if exocyst is directly involved in fusion of biosynthetic carriers to the plasma membrane. the final membrane fusion step of the membrane of pathways is mediated by snare proteins. snares interact to form four-helix bundles to promote membrane fusion, with each bundle requiring r-, qa-, qb-, and qc-snare motifs [167] . tsvsv-g positive post-golgi carriers accumulate upon snare inhibition by abrogation of the protein nsf [75] . as nsf is essential for snare function these experiments demonstrated that snare machinery is essential for fusion of the carriers. a targeted sirna screen identified the specific snares and sm (sec1/munc18-like) proteins which help to organise the snares [168] . 38 snares, 4 snare-like proteins and 7 sm proteins were targeted, 9 of which were identified and validated as being strongly inhibitory to secretory exocytosis. these 9 hits included proteins for both the er to golgi transport step and golgi to plasma membrane step. candidate validation identified the snares snap29 and syntaxin-19. snap29 has both a qb-and qc-snare domain [169] , and syntaxin-19 is qa-snare [170] . depletion of both syntaxin-19 and snap29 decreased plasma membrane fusion events of secretory vesicles, additionally in snap29 depleted cells there was an accumulation of pre-fusion carriers in the cytosol. surprisingly no r-snares were identified in this screen [168] . in a subsequent targeted screen drosophila cells were used, which have less genomic redundancy than mammalian cell lines. results from the screen highlighted the r-snares ykt6 and vamp3 as important for fusion of post-golgi secretory carriers, consistent with mammalian cells [171] , although ykt6 is a promiscuous snare that also has a role in er to golgi transport [168] . in summary, one of the snare complexes for the secretory route to the plasma membrane requires snap29 and syntaxin-19 and perhaps vamp3 redundantly with ykt6. there are likely multiple snare complexes for this route and multiple redundancies. lipids play a central role in the budding of carriers from the trans-golgi (reviewed in [145] ). one of the major lipids in this process is the phosphoinositide pi(4)p [105] see also section 5.1 above. pi(4)p is crucial for post-golgi vesicle biogenesis including carriers destined directly for the cell surface. enriched on the cytosolic outer membrane bilayer, pi(4)p can recruit an array of specificbinding proteins. mammals encode four different pi 4-kinases and pi(4)kiiiβ is involved in the formation of tsvsv-g carriers destined for the plasma membrane [107, 127] . pi(4)kiiiβ is recruited to the golgi by different mechanisms [105] including by the action of arf1 [172] and the golgi localised acbd3 [173] . once at the trans-golgi, pi(4)kiiiβ generates pi(4)p that recruits further proteins such as golph3 and lipid transport proteins as discussed below. pi(4)kiiiβ is also involved in the recruitment of the small g protein rab11a [174, 175] shown to be important for tsvsv-g trafficking from the trans-golgi to the plasma membrane [176] . pi(4)kiiiβ was shown to have an important role in mitochondrial scission generating pi(4)p on trans-golgi derived vesicles after recruitment by arf1 [177] . these vesicles are targeted to mitochondria-er contact sites and are thought to drive mitochondrial division downstream of drp1 (dynamin-related protein-1). one example of a pi(4)p mediated binding is golph3, discovered via a proteomic lipid-binding screen, which is recruited to the trans-golgi by interacting with pi(4)p [178] . golph3 binds to the unconventional myosin myo18a thus connecting the golgi to f-actin. the model suggests that this complex applies tension to extract the carriers at the trans-golgi. knock-down of golph3 or myo18a or actin depolymerisation impairs trafficking of tsvsv-g from the golgi to the plasma membrane. additionally, golph3 induces membrane curvature, by inserting a loop into the proximal leaflet of the bilayer and this property is required for efficient trans-golgi to plasma membrane trafficking [179] . however, golph3 has also been shown to specifically bind and recycle a subset of golgi enzymes involved in glycan assembly on sphingolipids [180] . this role of golph3 matches the role of its yeast homolog vps74 which binds to pi(4)p at the trans-golgi and interacts with specific golgi enzymes allowing their retrograde transport [181,182]. 7.3 lipid transport proteins pi(4)p recruits a range of lipid transport proteins (reviewed in [183] [184] [185] ), such as fapp2, oxysterol-binding protein (osbp), and ceramide transfer protein (cert). these proteins share a similar domain organisation: an n-terminal ph domain that binds pi(4)p (and simultaneously arf1-gtp for osbp and fapp2), a c-terminal ffat motif that binds the er membrane protein vap and a c-terminal lipid transport domain. fapp2 transfers glccer to the trans-golgi [112] as described in section 5.1 above. at membrane contact sites, osbp directs cholesterol transfer from the er to the trans-golgi through coupled counter-transport of pi(4)p [142, 186] . cert transports ceramide from the er to the trans-golgi [187] , thereby promoting sm and diacylglycerol synthesis. sterols and sphingolipids, which are suggested to assemble into lipid microdomains are important for the formation of secretory carriers [132, 188] . in agreement, depletion of vap inhibits trans-golgi to plasma membrane transport of tsvsv-g [189] . similarly, vap knockdown, double knockdown of cert/osbp or the treatment of the cells with dceramide-c6, impairs the secretion of the cargo pauf [141] . another lipid transfer protein that functions at contact sites between the er and the trans-golgi is nir2 [184] . nir2 supplies the trans-golgi with pi in exchange of phosphatidylcholine and thereby participates in pi(4)p synthesis and diacylglycerol homeostasis [190] . as a result, depletion of nir2 affects the transport of tsvsv-g from the trans-golgi to the cell surface. similarly, two other pi transfer proteins, pitpna and pitpnb, stimulate the production of pi(4)p which promotes the recruitment of golph3 and cert to the golgi thus facilitating the apical targeting of membrane trafficking in neural stem cells [191] . overall, lipid transfer proteins by executing non-vesicular lipid exchange are essential for the remodelling of the lipid landscape and, as a result, er-golgi contact sites could represent key sites for secretory cargo sorting and membrane fission. in yeast, pi(4)p has a key role in the generation of secretory vesicles during polarized growth. the pi(4)-kinase pik1, responsible for pi(4)p synthesis at the trans-golgi, regulates several transport events including the golgi to surface route [192] . together with the activated rabgtpase ypt32, pi(4)p recruits the exchange factor sec2 to the trans-golgi which in turn activates another rab, sec4 [193, 194] . the secretory vesicles subsequently pinch off and sec4 recruits the exocyst component sec15 to promote the tethering and fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane [195, 196] . pi(4)p, ypt32-gtp, sec4-gtp and then sec15 recruit myo2, a type v myosin, to allow the transport of vesicles along actin cables toward the exocytic site [197] [198] [199] . additionally, sec2 is able to bind directly to the sec4 effector sec15 [200] . sec15 and ypt32-gtp compete for binding to sec2. also, the association of sec2 with its alternate binding partners is regulated by pi(4)p [193] . thus, when secretory vesicles are initially formed and enriched in pi(4)p, sec2 interacts with its initial binding partner ypt32-gtp. it was shown that the concentration of pi(4)p on secretory vesicles is reduced by the time of their arrival at the cell surface [193, 201] by the action of the protein osh4 [201] . this suggests that during the maturation of secretory vesicles, as the pi(4)p concentration drops, ypt32-gtp is replaced on sec2 by sec15 leading to a positive feedback loop and thus preparing the vesicles for docking and fusion with the plasma membrane. furthermore, an additional regulatory level is accomplished by the phosphorylation of sec2 by casein kinases yck1/yck2 [202, 203] . sec2 phosphorylation inhibits its interaction with its initial binding partners pi(4)p and ypt32-gtp and promotes its interaction with its downstream effector sec15. additionally, yck2 binds to sec2 near the pi(4)p binding region and the presence of pi(4)p inhibits phosphorylation of sec2 by yck2 in vitro [202, 203] . this suggests that phosphorylation of sec2 is initially prevented by the high level of pi(4)p in nascent secretory vesicles. as the secretory vesicle matures and the pi(4)p level drops, sec2 gets phosphorylated promoting the switch in sec2 binding partners and thus pushing the reaction forwards. altogether, this complex regulatory circuit helps to impose a directionality in vesicular transport and shows the key role of pi(4)p in the secretory route. this rab cascade is somewhat conserved in mammalian cells and involves the ypt32-homologue rab11 recruiting the exchange factor rabin8 to activate the sec4homologue rab8 [204] . there are some differences, however, for example the lipid phosphatidylserine participating in the golgi recruitment of rabin8 in mammalian cells instead of pi(4)p in yeast [205] . glucose induces a change in intracellular ph that governs the protonation state of pi(4)p at the trans-golgi [206] . this regulates recruitment of osh1, a member of the osbp family of lipid transfer proteins, which promotes the trafficking of the tat2 amino acid permease to the plasma membrane regulating tryptophan uptake. this study shows that ph biosensing by pi(4)p in response to nutrient availability regulates cargo sorting at the trans-golgi. at this stage, we still do not have a clear picture of the exact molecular machinery of the pleomorphic sorting carriers that bud from the golgi apparatus and new types of carriers are emerging [207] . this is complicated by the fact that these carriers are transient and contain low cargo abundance. accordingly, they have mostly been observed using temporal kinetic assays, such as tsvsv-g and rush. many of the cargos used are exogenous proteins, including nonmammalian proteins such as gfp and hrp fused to a signal peptide and human proteins that are not expressed normally in that cell type. these techniques are essential and have facilitated fundamental discoveries over the years. it is important, although technically challenging, to investigate these carriers using native proteins under more physiological conditions. j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f mutations in genes encoding for proteins involved in the trans-golgi export machinery have been shown to cause severe genetic diseases [66, 208] . for example, mutations in different subunits of the ap-1-complex, component of clathrin-coated vesicles and associated with the trans-golgi and early/recycling endosomes, are linked with x-linked mental retardation and with mednik syndrome (mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, peripheral neuropathy, ichthyosis and keratodermia). other genetic diseases have been linked to mutations in ap subunits [66] . therefore a better understanding of the mechanistic basis of these pathologies is essential. there are also a number of diseases associated with secreted proteins. one example is transthyretin (ttr) amyloidosis: a rare genetic disease caused by over 80 known mutations in the secreted protein ttr [209] , resulting in protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils [210] . monoclonal gammopathies, caused by an abundance of a particular immunoglobulin into the blood (igm, igg, ige or a combination), are another example of a disease associated with protein secretion [211, 212] . our current understanding of the machinery is still incomplete and it is possible that diseases associated with mutations in this pathway are yet to be genetically characterised. how many routes are there from the golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane? it is possible that tsvsv-g takes multiple routes from the golgi apparatus (fig, 2) , which makes the number of routes that leave the golgi hard to interpret. similarly, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (gpi-aps) traffic to the apical surface of most epithelial cells, however, there are some exceptions such as fischer rat thyroid cells where gpi-aps are sorted to the basolateral surface [213] . in figure 2 , the schematic shows the various carriers that have been shown experimentally. it is of course possible, for example, that the rab6 carriers and lamp1-rush carriers shown in the image are the same. one reason for multiple pathways from the golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane is due to polarised sorting in some cell types. examples of polarised cells are epithelial tissues such as the choroid plexus that makes up a portion of the blood-brain barrier and is responsible for the secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (csf). neurons, another polarised cell type, are characterised by a long axonal process, reaching a meter in length in humans. polarised cells need to maintain differential protein trafficking in the cellular subdomains, for example, the choroid plexus polarised epithelial layer faces fenestrated capillaries on the basolateral side and the ventricular space on the apical side where the csf is secreted. the generation, maintenance and trafficking of cell polarity has been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere [214] [215] [216] . the machinery that mediates the sorting into the two different routes is still being characterised. it seems likely that some of the machinery discussed in this review is essential, for example loss of fapp2 in mdck cells causes loss of complete polarisation and defective cilium formation and is important for delivery of apical cargos [111, 217] . it is possible that the routes that exist in polarised cells also exist in 'non-polarised' cells and act as redundant or alternative routes to the plasma membrane, as demonstrated in comparisons of trafficking nonpolarised fao cells with polarised wif-b cells [218] . a final outstanding question is the presence of a 'coat'. all other known carriers characterised todate have a coat of some sort. in the case of clathrin coated vesicles it is a geometric lattice that directly forms and scaffolds the forming vesicles, in the retromer coat it is a core complex that allows for cargo selectivity and binding to other machinery. although, as discussed above, there are some candidate proteins, there is still no bona fide coat for the secretory carriers. perhaps there is no need for a coat in these carriers or perhaps it has yet to be discovered. with the recent advances in genetics and proteomics there is surely more to be discovered on this elusive trafficking pathway. figure 1 : destinations of proteins from the golgi apparatus. proteins arrive into the golgi apparatus from either the er (bottom of the schematic) or endolysosomal system (top of the schematic). after arrival proteins can either return to the er in copi vesicles (light blue), can be retained in the golgi apparatus, can be delivered directly to the plasma membrane (yellow) or delivered to the endolysosomal system by either clathrin (red) or other clathrin independent mechanism (eg, ap4, green). models from experimental data on different types of secretory tubular carriers that bud towards the plasma membrane in mammalian cells. the carriers have been drawn as separate entities unless there is strong experimental evidence to combine the carriers. some of the machinery described here might be overlapping on the same carriers, for example the sm carriers and carts, and the lamp1-rush carriers, rab6 carriers and the arf1 carriers. protein cartoons are not to scale and do not meaningfully reflect protein structure. lyz = lysozyme c. there are 2 tethering complexes associated with post-golgi carriers, elks

cargo represents bulk flow as assayed by
feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv), family coronaviridae, genus coronavirus, produces a chronic, progressive, immunologically mediated disease in domestic and exotic cats. fipv is classified as type i and type ii (pedersen et al., 1984; hohdatsu et al., 1991a,b) . the fipv type i virus group shows poor proliferative activity in cell culture, and a neutralization test for this virus group is also difficult. on the other hand, the fipv type ii virus group proliferates well in cell culture, and is widely used for studying fipv. in the case of strain 79-1146 in the type ii group, all of the base sequences have been identified (jacobs et al., 1987; vennema et al., 1991) . both types i and ii cause infectious peritonitis in cats, but the pathogenicity of type ii fipv is greater than that of type i fipv (pedersen, 1987) . however, in the field, the prevalence of fipv type i is high, and about 70% of feline cases of fip are due to infection with type i (hohdatsu et al., 1992) . to help the study of fipv type i it is necessary to improve the method of in vitro culture. some studies have shown that infectivity is enhanced by centrifugation of cells following viral inoculation onto cell cultures for influenza virus (woods and johnson, 1989; seno et al., 1990) , herpesvirus (oefinger et al., 1990; tenser, 19781, human immunodeficiency virus (pietroboni et al., 19891 , and blue tongue virus (sundin and mecham, 1989) . centrifugal inoculation of fipv type i was investigated as a technique to improve the in vitro infectivity of this virus. fipv strains ucd-1, ucd-2, nw-l, black, ku-2 and 79-1146 were used in this study. among these virus strains, ucd-1, ucd-2, nw-l, black and ku-2 show cell-associated growth, and are therefore regarded as type i virus strains in the classification of pedersen et al. (1984) . strain ucd-1 was kindly supplied by dr. n.c. pedersen (university of california, davis, ca, usa) and strains nw-l, black and ucd-2 were kindly supplied by dr. j.k. yamamoto (university of florida, usa). strain ku-2 was isolated from peritoneal cells of an adult cat with the effusive form of fip in this laboratory. type ii fipv strain 79-1146, showing non-cell associated growth, was kindly supplied by dr. h.c. horzinek, the state university, utrecht, the netherlands. these viruses were grown in feline whole fetus cells (fcwf-4). the fcwf-4 cells were grown in eagle's minimum essential medium containing 50% leibovitz l-15 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin per ml and 100 pg of streptomycin per ml. a preliminary experiment determined whether or not the centrifugal inoculation method would be effective for culture of fipv as well. strain ku-2, which was serially diluted lo-fold, was inoculated at 100 pi/well onto fcwf-4 cells cultured in a 96-well microplate, and then centrifuged at 25°c and 400 x g (1500 rpm> for 2 h by means of a ts-9 rotor for plates (tomy seiko co., ltd., japan). after centrifugation, the cells were incubated in a co, incubator at 37°c for 5 days. the infectious titers obtained with centrifuged cells and the control cells without centrifugation were compared. the centrifuged cells had infectious titers about 30 times as high as that in the control group, suggesting that the centrifugal inoculation method is effective for culturing fipv as well. the most efficient time for centrifugation at 400 x g was determined by plaque assay. 1 ml of strain ku-2 was inoculated onto fcwf-4 cells cultured in a 24-well multiplate, and then the cells were centrifuged at 25°c for 0 mitt, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h. after centrifugation, the cells were incubated at 37°c for 1 h, and washed with hanks' balanced salt solution (hbss). 1 ml/well of the medium containing 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose was added. the cells were incubated in a co, incubator at 37°c for 5 days, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and stained with 1% crystal violet. the numbers of plaques obtained after each centrifugation time are shown in fig. 1 . the number of plaques after centrifugation for 2 h was about 20 times as large as that in the absence of centrifugation. it was also found that the number of plaques was decreased by centrifugation for 2 h or longer. the reason for the decrease in infectious titer after a certain centrifugation time is not clear, but prolonged centrifugation may affect the cells adversely. the centrifugation time may be shortened and the infectious titer may be increased1 by centrifngation at 400 x g or greater. since the maximum frequency of rotation of the ts-9 rotor, which was used, is 1500 rpm (400 x g>, however, these results could not be confirmed. an investigation was carried out to determine whether or not the centrifugal inoculation method would be effective for fipv type ii strain 79-l 146 and fipv type i strains other than strain ku-z. each virus strain was inoculated onto fcw&4 cells cultured in a 96-well microplate, and then centrifuged at 400 x g for 2 h. table 1 shows the comparison of infectious titers in the centrifuged cells with those without centrifuga- table 1 the effect of centrifugal inoculation on the replication of fipv in fcwf-4 cell cultures centrifugation virus dilution strain 100 10-r 10-z 10-s 10-4 lo-5 10-e 10-7 10-s  a number of cpe positive wells/number of tested wells. tion. the titer was increased in all of the strains, especially type i virus strains, suggesting that this method is effective for culturing fipv. the time when the effect (centrifugal enhancement) would have occurred, at the time of attachment/adsorption of viruses to the cells or thereafter, was experimentally determined in the fipv system. the enhancing effect was studied with strain black by plaque assay. after viral inoculation, the cells were divided into four groups according to the following methods: those that were centrifuged at 400 x g for 2 h immediately after the inoculation (method a); those that were washed with hbss after adsorption at 37°c for 1 h, followed by centrifugation (method b), those onto which viruses were inoculated after centrifugation of the cells alone for 2 h (method c), and those that were not centrifuged as the controls (method d). infectious titers of these groups were fig. 2 . the titer was increased only when the cells were centrifuged immediately after viral inoculation. this result suggests that the enhancement of infection occurs at the time of attachment/adsorption of viruses to the cells. even when viruses were inoculated onto cells that were preliminarily centrifuged, infection was not enhanced. simultaneous centrifugation of the viruses and the cells was necessary for the enhancement of infection. it is impossible that centrifugation at 400 x 6 would have directly caused an increase in the efficiency of attachment/adsorption of the viruses to the cells. centrifugation of cells may induce changes in the cell's virus receptor, and if a virus is present there, it will become easy for it to be attached or adsorbed to the cell, possibly leading to enhancement of infection. prior to this study, centrifugal enhancement of infection had not been reported for any coronavirus. we have shown that the centrifugal inoculation method allowed an increase in infectivity titer of fipv, especially type i virus strains. this method may also be effective for the isolation of other coronaviruses whose culture is difficult.
introduction globally, more than 40 million substantiated cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) have been recorded, with more than one million deaths [1] . beyond supportive care, there are currently no proven effective treatment options for covid-19 [2] , although few treatment modalities such as remdesivir [3] , tocilizumab [4] , convalescent plasma (cp) [5] and mesenchymal stem cell (msc) [6] therapy have shown early evidence of efficacy. with approximately 60% mortality [7] in critical cases, it is postulated that the fatal outcomes of covid-19 are associated with excessive immune response. cytokine release syndrome (crs) manifests many abnormalities such as lymphopenia, high levels of c-reactive protein (crp), high ferritin, high d-dimers, high lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and interleukin-6 (il-6). these biochemical manifestations of crs and significantly abnormal coagulation parameters were commonly found in severe and critically ill patients who did not survive [7] . severe and critical covid-19 patients are prone to develop sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and/or multiple organ failure through immune dysregulation. it has been hypothesized that therapeutic plasma exchange (tpe), by removing pathogenic cytokines may have an additional role in managing early sepsis having onset less than 12 h [8] . our study attempted to demonstrate that dampening of the cytokine syndrome (improvement of symptoms and settling of crs markers) by using tpe when initiated within one week of crs onset might be beneficial to the patients with covid-19 having crs. however, no prospective study on tpe has been conducted so far in patients with covid-19 triggered crs. this study was a retrospective, propensity score matched (psm) and single center, conducted at pak emirates military hospital (pemh), rawalpindi (pakistan). pemh is the largest tertiary care military hospital of the country with a capacity of approximately 1200-1400 beds. the hospital is equipped with all necessary and advanced healthcare facilities for the management of covid-19 including tpe, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) and all investigational pharmacological modalities. data of all hospitalized patients are maintained by covid-19 research and evaluation cell of the hospital. all data were fully anonymized before retrieval. ethical review committee pak emirates military hospital rawalpindi approved the study. the data were extracted for patients with covid-19 admitted with or developing crs during their admission from april 1 st to 31st july 2020. as the identity of the patients was not visible, informed written consent was waivered off by the president ethical review committee pak emirates military hospital rawalpindi. records of the patients were assessed during 3 rd week of august 2020. inclusion criteria included: (1) covid-19 diagnosed by real time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) positivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (sars-cov-2) (2) crs at presentation or developing during hospitalization (3) age range 18-80 years and both genders (4) hospital admission (5) at least 1 completed session of plasma-exchange in patients included in tpe arm. exclusion criteria were: (1) death within 48 hours of admission (2) severe septic shock at the time of admission (3) congestive cardiac failure (ejection fraction <20%) (4) those receiving immunotherapy, anti-thymocyte globulin or hematopoietic stem cell transplant in last 6 months (5) patients of hematological or solid organ malignancies (6) patients receiving other investigational drugs including tocilizumab, cp, remdesivir, or msc therapy. retrospective observational studies involving therapeutic interventions are often confounded by either measured or unmeasured baseline characteristics. as a result, baseline characteristics of treated subjects differ from untreated ones. to account for these systematic differences, we conducted a psm analysis of patients of covid-19 triggered crs treated with or without tpe. psm was performed on a cohort of patients meeting above inclusion and exclusion criteria. for the estimation of propensity score we used a logistic regression model (data matching greedy) on nccs statistical software v20.0.2 [9] . data of 90 patients selected by this propensity-matching software are attached as s1 file. the number of controls were matched with the tpe treatment group in 1:1 matching. the distance calculation method used was the mahalanobis distance including the propensity score, order for matching was random 1:1 and caliper radius was set at 1 � sigma. for ensuring comparable groups, forced matching was done for disease severity, standard care and advanced treatment at disease escalation. co-variate matching was done for age, duration of illness, symptoms at presentation, comorbidities, serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimers, c-reactive protein (crp) levels, the absolute lymphocyte count (alc), platelet count and oxygen requirement at the time of crs diagnosis. median and range were used for continuous variables while frequency and percentage were used to express categorical statistics. the chi-square test was used to evaluate differences in categorical variables while students t-test or mann-whitney u test was used to evaluate continuous variables. kaplan-meier test was used for survival analysis and log rank was used to compare difference in the two groups. cox-proportional hazards were used to generate hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for the outcome. p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. confirmation of covid-19. covid-19 was confirmed by positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) on nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs done at armed forces institute of pathology (afip). the three specific genes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), namely the open reading frame (1a/b (orf1a/b), nucleocapsid protein (n), and envelope protein (e) genes, were amplified by rt-pcr technology. result was declared positive when orf1a/b gene was positive, and/or n gene/e gene positive. the severity of disease. it was defined according to the criteria designed by who [10] . moderate disease was defined as covid-19-positive case with lung infiltrates < 50% of total lung fields on x-ray chest/peripheral ground glass opacities (ggos) on high-resolution computerized tomography (hrct) chest scan but no evidence of hypoxemia. severe disease was defined as covid-19 pneumonia with evidence of hypoxemia [respiratory rate (rr more than 30/minute or partial pressure of oxygen (pao2) on arterial blood gas (abgs) less than 80 mmhg or pao2/fio2 (pf ratio) less than 300 or lung infiltrates more than 50% of the lung field]. critical disease was defined if there was covid-19 pneumonia with evidence of either respiratory failure (pao2 less than 60 mmhg) or multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (mods) measured by sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) score more than 10 or septic shock (systolic bp less than 90 or less than 40mm hg of baseline in hypertensive or urine output less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour). all categories of patients were managed in the high dependency unit of the hospital except those who required invasive ventilation during the course of illness. crs. it was defined by national guidelines for covid-19 [11] . crs was diagnosed as fever of equal to or more than 100˚f persisting for more than 48 hours in absence of documented bacterial infection and any of the following in the presence of moderate, severe or critical disease; (1) ferritin more than 1000 mcg/l and rising in last 24 hours prior to crs diagnosis (2) ferritin more than 2000 mcg/l in patient requiring high flow oxygen or ventilation (3) lymphopenia less than 800 lymphocytes/ul or lymphocyte percentage <20% and two of the following (a) ferritin more than 700 mcg/ml and rising in the last 24 hours prior to crs diagnosis (b) ldh more than 300 iu (reference 140-250 iu/l) and rising in the last 24 hours prior to crs diagnosis (c) d-dimer more than 1000 ng/ml (or more than 1mcg/ml) and rising in the last 24 hours prior to crs diagnosis (d) crp more than 70 mg/l and rising in the last 24 hours prior to crs diagnosis, in absence of bacterial infection (e) if any 3 of above presents on admission no need to document rise. standard of care (soc). it was as per institutional covid-19 management guidelines. all patients with moderate, severe and critical covid-19 received standard protocol of aspirin, famotidine, anticoagulation, vitamin c, vitamin d, oral zinc, awake proning (if pao2 < 80mmhg) and corticosteroids. all patients of crs received methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg irrespective of disease severity. tpe procedure. in addition to soc, tpe was offered as a trial investigational therapy to willing patients with crs. all patients were explained the investigational role of tpe in treatment of covid-19. written consent was taken from those who agreed for this treatment. tpe was performed once daily using cobe spectra apheresis machine version 7 (manufacturer terumo bct, lakewood, co, usa inc) with continuous flow centrifugation. venous access was achieved using an ultrasound guided double lumen catheter (arrow-12 fr) via the femoral vein. patient's total blood volume was calculated as per nadler's formula [12] . anticoagulant acid dextrose ratio was 1:10 and flow rate 30-40 ml/minutes (adjusted as per hemodynamic status). patients' blood pressure, pulse and oxygen saturation were monitored throughout the procedure. the duration of procedure varied from 2-4 hours and 1.5 times total plasma volume was removed during each procedure. replacement fluid was fresh frozen plasma (ffp) and normal saline in 2:1 respectively. all procedures were performed in intensive care by apheresis department of pemh and patients were shifted back to the high dependency unit immediately after procedure. tpe was continued once daily until recovery. the median follow-up time after last tpe session was 28 days. tpe related complications were also documented. recovery. it was defined by de-escalation of patients' condition from critical, severe and moderate disease to mild disease plus at least 2 of the following; serum ferritin < 1000 ug/ml (and decreasing trend on two consecutive days), serum ldh normalization, c-reactive protein > 50% reduction (and decreasing trend in two consecutive days), absolute lymphocyte count (alc) > 1000. study end points. the primary end point was 28-day survival defined by discharge from hospital and remain symptom free on weekly follow-ups until 28th day after the last session of tpe. patient discharge criteria included normalization of crp, ldh, d-dimers and fall in serum ferritin to less than 500 mcg/ml plus an afebrile period of at least 72 hours, and maintaining oxygen saturation more than 93% for at least 72 h without supplemental oxygen support. secondary outcome measures were (1) duration of hospitalization (2)  patient selection procedure is shown in fig 1. on initial screening of data for the patients with covid-19, 315 cases of crs were found. after applying the exclusion criteria, 280 eligible patients were included in psm analysis (data are available in zip folder attached as s1 file) using 1:1 matching, 45 pairs of patients were formed, treated with or without tpe. the baseline characteristics of patients before and after matching are shown in table 1 . there were significant differences in tpe treated and untreated groups, which were addressed after matching. the overall eligible cohort was 245/280 (87.5%) males and 35/280 (12.5%) females, with a median age of 62 years (range 20-80 years) p-value 0.05, while 150/280 dvt), which were managed optimally. overall survival was significantly superior in the tpe group (91.1%), 95% ci 78.33-97.76; compared to ps-matched controls (61.5%), 95% ci 51.29-78.76 (log rank 0.002), p<0.001. (fig 2) . cox regression analysis was performed to analyze the effect of covariate on survival outcome in both groups. after adjusting for age, comorbidities, disease severity and duration of symptoms, overall survival (os) in a tpe group remained superior to the psm control group (p<0.001), hr 0.21 and 95% ci 0.07-.636. regarding effect of comorbidities in tpe group; (n = 45), overall survival (os) was 100% for 21 patients without comorbidities compared to 83.4% for 24 patients with comorbidities. in patients not receiving tpe (n = 45), os was 77% for 21 patients without comorbidities and  therapeutic plasma exchange for coronavirus disease-2019 triggered cytokine release syndrome 46% in 24 patients with comorbidities (p = 0.023). out of 45 patients in each study group, 3 patients had moderate, 20 had severe and 22 had critical covid-19 in each cohort respectively. overall survival for patients with moderate, severe and critical covid-19 was 100%, 100% and 81.8% for the tpe group compared to 100%, 90% and 40.9% for patients not receiving tpe (log rank 0.002) (fig 3) . the time of resolution of crs was significantly reduced in the tpe group. from the time of admission until day 15, the cumulative incidence for normalization of crs was 90% in the tpe group vs. 50% for psm-controls. the gray's test was applied to cater for completing risk and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). overall, 108/280 (38.6%) patients remained pcr-positive on day 7 of the first pcr positivity and 29/280 (10.35%) on day 14 of first pcr positivity with or without tpe. the median duration of hospitalization was significantly reduced in the tpe treated group compared to non-tpe controls (10 days vs. 15 days (p< 0.01). this study demonstrates that addition of tpe to the soc (inclusive of steroids) for moderate, severe and critical covid-19 with crs is associated with significant survival benefits especially in critical disease. tpe remarkably decreases the duration of hospitalization and resolution of crs. however, pcr positivity on day 7 and 14 remained unchanged with addition of tpe. this finding is to be expected since evidence suggests the presence of non-replicable viral nucleic acid material only, after day 10 of onset of illness, being picked up by the pcr [13, 14] . to neutralize more comprehensively for biases associated with the selection of a particular mode of treatment, we stringently matched tpe and standard of care (soc) treatment groups using a psm analysis. the strength of the conclusion stems from the fact that many variables given in table 1 in both arms had to be matched before analysis. tpe appears promising as an investigational therapy for several convincing reasons. first, tpe [15] has been used in secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (shlh) (recommendation iii,2c; optimum role of tpe unestablished but low-quality evidence available), thrombotic microangiopathy secondary to various causes (various categories and strengths of evidence) and septic shock (recommendation iii,2b; optimum role of tpe not established but moderate quality evidence available). as all or some of these pathologies may be present in severe to critical covid-19 hence the role of tpe in treatment of covid-19 may be partially justified. the cytokine profile of severe covid-19 closely resembles shlh [16] and it is also associated with venous and arterial thromboembolic complications [17] and septic shock [18] . therefore, it was postulated that tpe will be similarly beneficial if used in covid-19 triggered crs. second, tpe has also been successfully used previously for the managing severe infections such as 2009 hin1 influenza a [19] and sepsis with multiorgan failure [8, 20, 21] . third, tpe has been proposed as a possible supportive treatment of fulminant sars-cov-2 infection [22] . moreover, tpe has also been shown to be effective in few case reports of covid-19 [23, 24] . however, it has been argued that it's benefit in covid-19 should be expected only in macrophage activation syndrome, or sepsis complicated with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (mods) [25] . it has been found that pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly higher around 2nd week of illness [26] thus, key to success is early recognition of crs, with early initiation of tpe. in this study, the median time to start the first tpe session from the date of admission was 3.5 days (iqr; 2-5, mean;3.96) and the patients who underwent tpe within 12 days of onset of symptoms had a remarkably improved survival. hence, our study demonstrated better results of tpe when used earlier during the course of disease. the first reported study to our knowledge on the use of tpe in covid-19 was conducted retrospectively on invasively ventilated patients receiving > 2 vasopressors which showed the greatest mortality benefit with tpe in these patients, (47.8% mortality in the tpe group vs. 81.3% mortality in the soc group), (p = 0.05) [22] . in comparison, this study having larger sample size and done at various stages of illness (moderate, severe and critical cases), with only 6 patients on mechanical ventilation included, showed a significant benefit of tpe in severe and critical disease at a stage short of invasive ventilation. an emergency use of tpe in three patients with covid-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome was published as case series [24] that suggested that tpe had an immediate effect on the treatment of the crs. duration of hospitalization in these case reports was 18 to 25 days while it was 10 days in our study. this disparity might because of our discharge criteria that did not include pcr negativity which was one of the prerequisites in these reported cases. even in the psm control group, our study showed a mortality of 38.5% that is significantly lesser compared with a large retrospective study [7] showing a mortality of 60% in critical disease. the possible reasons might be the inclusion of moderate, severe and critical categories in our psm cohort rather than only critical cases and the addition of steroids to all treatment groups having evidence of crs. it has been seen that coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-cov (mers) predominantly affect the male gender [27] and may be for the same genetic reasons, sars-cov-2 is also predominantly affecting male population as seen in pre psm cohort of our study. another reason for a predominant male population being infected in our study was our entitled clientele of the hospital was mainly from male gender. nonetheless, this study had few limitations. first, it was a retrospective study which in itself has weaker evidence compared to prospective trials. second, female gender was not represented in this study after psm therefore results of this trial is exclusively applied to male gender only and a comparative analysis cannot be done. third, although a strict psm analysis was done, still all biases cannot be eliminated. fourth, we did not follow up patients beyond 28 days from first tpe session due to lack of resources and huge influx of new covid-19 cases. lastly, in tpe procedure, we used centrifugation tpe machine rather than continuous hemofiltration (chf) which removes more il-6 and similar cytokines molecular mass of 21 to 54.1 kda [28] due to lack of availability of filters. nevertheless, even after considering such limitations, using tpe, in addition to standard treatment in patients with covid-19 may mitigate the cytokine storm. tpe shows promise, and we propose that large, multi-centric, randomized trials be designed to further investigate its role. in conclusion, tpe may be a lifesaving modality, with a statistically significant survival benefit, a decreased hospitalization time and an almost halved crs resolution time, if started earlier at the onset of crs in the treatment of severe and critical covid-19 in the male population. supporting information s1 file.
